            <p> <span>Curriculum Design for Kindergarten : </span>
                The Kindergarten curriculum is based on age-specific learning goals and designed with a view to modern
                educational trends and the needs of the children. We adopt a thematic approach to foster learning across
                the curriculum, emphasising the development of key skills. We plan across different areas of learning,
                facilitating the children's development at their own pace through differentiated and collaborative
                learning. The curriculum is child-oriented, focusing on play and individual personality. We firmly
                believe that children need to be happy to learn. Our modern curriculum provides opportunities for play,
                exploration, active learning, and creative thinking. We carefully plan and support enriched programs
                that stimulate children's interest. We expose the children to a variety of exciting and positive
                experiences and hands-on activities that enable them to explore and enliven their interests. We
                encourage them to think and talk about these experiences. The integration of all areas of learning
                offers ample opportunities for children to make connections between their experiences. While keeping
                international standards in mind, the curriculum for our little learners is based on early learning goals
                that they need to achieve by the end of Kindergarten. We have successfully adapted this assessment
                pattern to provide the necessary range and balance. The curriculum framework provides a detailed view of
                the concepts covered in all seven teaching areas.</p> <br><br>

                <p>We offer a child-centered and developmentally appropriate program for three to five year-old
                    children. <a href="index.html">The International School Agra</a>  focuses to implement play-based learning framework of

                    regarding all areas of child development social/emotional, physical, cognitive, and language. The
                    teachers use their own experiences, as well as the children's interests, to adapt the curriculum to
                    be unique to each class at The International School Agra. Classroom observations become important
                    tools for the teachers to communicate with parents. Play allows children to learn about themselves
                    and their surroundings. As children play, they learn new skills, develop mechanism and explore new
                    ideas.</p> <br> <br>
                <p>Children learn variety of skills for example-building with blocks promotes material exploration, as
                    well as spatial planning, symbolic representation, dramatic play, and social interactions. As
                    children use art materials, they are planning and carrying out a task and also using symbols to
                    represent their ideas.</p> <br><br>
                <p>Our play-based curriculum offers children many opportunities for positive interactions with other
                    children and adults. We treat each child with respect and reinforce his/her value as an individual
                    and as a unique member of the school.</p>
